## Browser rendering engine
#### Software that renders HTML pages (Web pages). It turns the HTML layout tags in the page into the appropriate commands for the operating system, which causes the formation of the text characters and images for screen and printer. Also called a "layout engine," a rendering engine is used by a Web browser to render HTML pages, by mail programs that render HTML email messages, as well as any other application that needs to render Web page content.

* ### HTML & CSS Rendering :
 The rendering engine will start parsing the HTML document and convert elements to DOM nodes in a tree called the "content tree". The engine will parse the style data, both in external CSS files and in style elements
*  ### Parser: 
A parser is a compiler or interpreter component that breaks data into smaller elements for easy translation into another language. A parser takes input in the form of a sequence of tokens or program instructions and usually builds a data structure in the form of a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree.
* ### paint() :
Each render object has a paint() which calls to display any object or text to the user.

# JAVA SCRIPT ENGINE
 A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript (JS) code. The first JS engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines utilize just-in-time compilation for improved performance.
 ### List of JS engine and their inventors

 * CHAKRA core
 * Spider monkey
 * Hermes engine

# Difference between Interpreter and Compiler Language
---
  | Compiler       | Interpreted        | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|It considers the completion of your program as input for converting to machine code.|	It considers 1 statement in your program at a time as input for converting to machine code.|
|It usually generates intermediate code in the form of the object file (.obj).|	It doesn't create an intermediate object (.obj) code.|
|Faster execution of control statements as compared to the interpreter.|	Slower execution of control statements as compared to the compiler.|
|Detected errors in the program get displayed after the entire program is read by compiler.|	Detected errors in the program get displayed after each instruction read by the interpreter.|
|Example: C++, Java.|	Example. BASIC, Python, PHP.|
